# Cooper Union Twitter Proxy
## A project dedicated to allowing easy exploration of the Twitter API

For years, I have hosted a series of proxies on Heroku, designed to let students in my classes learn from the data structures presented by many 3rd-party products, without having to learn of the intricacies of OAuth, CORS etc. By creating these proxies, students need only to register for a developer account with the 3rd-party service, enter in their relevant api keys, and be off to the races with simple client-side javascript applications.

Or.. at least that's how it was supposed to work. What ended up happening though was that the difficulty of getting Heroku setup for each student, forking a github repo, deploying their fork, setting up private keys etc... it never happened. Instead, I host a series of these proxies, and students just use my hosted version. This is great for ease of use, but challenging when you start trying to share one rate limit across 20 students.

The ~~Gomix~~ Glitch version of this project, for the first time, enables what I had always envisioned. "Remix" the project to your own account (and optionally give it a name), enter in your private keys and you're off to the races.

### Instructions
Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Glitch is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps.

Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
